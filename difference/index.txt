Some of the differences between React.js and Next.js are: 

React isn't efficient for a web-application when it comes to SEO(Search Engine Optimization)
Next.js solves that props allowing search engines access key words easily from the html Next.js relates to it.
Next.js offers Server side technology, though built on React, Next.js allows integeration for server side.
Next.js is built on React.js, but has a routing system inbuilt(create diferent routes in the pages directory)
Next.js also allows possible routes to be pre-loaded before the are even called upon, this allows for faster routing, React.js doesn't allow for that.
